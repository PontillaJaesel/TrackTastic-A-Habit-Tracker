# TrackTastic: Habit Tracking System 📊

## I. Project Overview 📝

**TrackTastic: A Habit Tracking System** is a comprehensive habit-tracking application designed to help users manage their daily and weekly habits effectively. By providing features such as personalized dashboards, detailed habit breakdowns, and progress tracking, TrackTastic aims to foster a structured approach to habit-building. Built using Java, this project adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### Key Features:
- **User Registration and Login** 🔑: Allows users to create accounts, log in securely, and access their personalized dashboard.
- **Account Dashboard** 📅: A central hub where users can manage their profile, view progress, and navigate the application.
- **Create, Update, and Delete Habit** ➕✏️❌: Empowers users to add new habits, modify existing ones, or remove them as needed.
- **View Existing Habit** 👀: Provides an organized display of current habits, categorized as daily or weekly, for easy tracking and management.

## II. Application of OOP Principles 💻

TrackTastic leverages the four fundamental principles of OOP: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

### Encapsulation 🔒
- The `User` class demonstrates encapsulation by using private fields such as `username` and `password`. Access to these fields is restricted through getter and setter methods, ensuring data integrity and controlled updates. For example, instead of exposing the password field directly, the class provides a `getPassword()` method to retrieve its value and a `setPassword()` method to update it. This approach ensures that changes to sensitive data are controlled and validated, maintaining the integrity and security of user information.

### Inheritance 🧬
- Inheritance is demonstrated in the relationship between the `User` and `UserHP` classes. The `UserHP` class inherits common attributes and methods, such as user credentials, from the `User` class. Additionally, `UserHP` extends this functionality by introducing unique features like progress tracking and the account dashboard. By reusing the base `User` class, the program avoids redundancy and simplifies the implementation of shared behaviors across related classes.

### Polymorphism 🌀
- Polymorphism is applied within the `Habit` hierarchy, where the abstract `Habit` class defines a method `trackProgress()` that is overridden by its subclasses, `Daily` and `Weekly`. Each subclass implements `trackProgress()` to handle habit tracking specific to its type. For instance, the `Daily` class might calculate progress based on daily goals, while the `Weekly` class focuses on weekly targets. This design allows the program to process various habit types uniformly through the `Habit` reference, while enabling behavior unique to each habit type.

### Abstraction 🎭
- The `Habit` class embodies abstraction by providing a framework of abstract methods that all subclasses must implement. For example, the abstract method `trackProgress()` ensures that both `Daily` and `Weekly` habits provide their own implementation of progress tracking. This guarantees a consistent interface for managing habits across the application, while allowing each habit type to tailor its functionality to specific requirements. By focusing on the essential aspects of habit management, the abstract class simplifies the overall program design and enforces a logical structure.
